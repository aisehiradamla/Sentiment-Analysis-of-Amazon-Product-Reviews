Business Challenge: 

One of the most significant challenges in the realm of e-commerce is accurately calculating the points awarded for after-sales products. This challenge, when resolved, can lead to increased customer satisfaction for the e-commerce site, better product visibility for sellers, and an overall seamless shopping experience for buyers. The presence of misleading comments amongst product reviews is a particularly prominent concern, as it can result in financial loss and customer attrition. To address these issues, Amazon seeks to rate and rank reviews based on sentiment (positive/negative) during the ordering process. Successfully addressing these two key challenges can lead to increased sales for both the e-commerce site and its sellers, while simultaneously ensuring a more enjoyable purchasing journey for customers.
